<p>python weather program with auto detecting location using Ipify, Ipapi and OpenWeatherMap</p>
<hr />
<h1> How it works</h1>
<h2> 1. Ipify</h2>
<p>Ipify works by sending a request to Ipify's servers and then they send back your Ip address<p/>
<hr />
<h2> 2.Ipapi </h2>
<p>Ipapi is a geolocation service using your IP address</p>
<hr />
<h2>3.OpenWeatherMaps</h2>
<p> OpenWeatherMaps works by inputing the city from Ipapi and getting the weather forecast.</p>
